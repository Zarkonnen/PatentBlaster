# PATENT BLASTER!!!

## I'm releasing this as open source
(The legal text is below, this is a summary and not part of the legal text.)

Basically, feel free to take the code and use it for your own projects, build on it, patch it, sell it, as long as you don't sue me if it breaks horribly. Those parts of the audio and images I made myself you can use and build on for non-commercial purposes. All other audio and images have whatever licensing terms they came with in the first place.

(End summary.)
